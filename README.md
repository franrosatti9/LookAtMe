# Look At Me [Early dev]
 3D open world exploration game, with puzzles and some parkour.
 
 You're a monster, and now an urban legend, tired of not being taken seriously. 
 Everyone who looks at you, dies, so you get into town seeking revenge. But it won't be that easy!
 This town's population will avoid and ignore everything around them, so you'll have to draw their attention in various ways and reach tricky spots to complete your revenge!
